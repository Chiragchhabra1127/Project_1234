🚀 Features

📝 Smart Notes
Generate clean, well-organized study notes on any topic, with headings, bullet points, bold key terms, and a summary section.

📖 Explain Topic
Get a clear explanation of any concept at your chosen level (Simple / Intermediate / Advanced), including a definition, key points, a real-world example, and a simple analogy.

📄 Summarize Text
Paste long notes or articles and get a one-line main idea, key bullet points, and important terms to remember.

🗂️ Flashcards
Auto-generate flip-style Q&A flashcards from any topic or pasted notes. Cards are parsed and displayed as individual cards with a "Reveal answer" expander — great for quick revision.

❓ Quiz Generator
Generate multiple-choice questions with adjustable difficulty and question count. Questions and options are auto-formatted so they always appear on clean, separate lines, with a full answer key at the end. Runs on a lighter, faster model for quicker results.

🎓 Exam Test Mode
Generate a complete, structured mock exam paper (Section A/B/C, marks per question, customizable total marks/duration/level) plus a model answer key — downloadable as a .txt file.

🎤 Ask a Doubt (Voice Enabled)
Type any question and get a clear, structured answer — or tap the microphone button to speak your question using your browser's built-in speech recognition (Chrome/Edge recommended), then copy the transcribed text into the question box.

🎨 Light / Dark Theme Toggle
Switch instantly between a warm cream "Light" theme and a deep navy "Dark" theme from the sidebar — both with a custom coral/amber accent palette and Fraunces + Inter typography.

🔑 Configure Gemini API Key

Option A — using a .env file (recommended for local use):
Create a ".env" file in the project root directory:

GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

Option B — enter it directly in the sidebar when the app is running. This is the easiest option, especially when deploying on Streamlit Cloud.

⚠️ Notes on API Usage

The free tier of the Gemini API has daily and per-minute request limits. If you see a "429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED" error, you have hit the free quota for the day — wait for it to reset or use a different API key. A "503 UNAVAILABLE" error means Google's servers are temporarily overloaded — simply retry after a short wait.
